Installing the Guest Additions on a GUI-less server
Start VirtualBox.
Start the host in question.
Once the host has booted, click Devices | Insert Guest Additions CD Image.
Log in to your guest server.
Mount the CD-ROM with the command sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom.
  (If you get a /media/cdrom does not exist error then you will need to create the mount point)
  mkdir /media/cdrom
  sudo mount -t auto /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
Change into the mounted directory with the command cd /media/cdrom.
Install the necessary dependencies with the command sudo apt-get install -y dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r).
Change to the root user with the command sudo su.
Install the Guest Additions package with the command ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run.
Allow the installation to complete.
You will see an error stating that the installer couldn't find the X.Org or XFree86 Window Systemâ€”that's okay, because it doesn't exist on this host.

Reboot your machine, and the Guest Additions will be working. You should see a bit of a performance increase, as well as the extra features (shared clipboard, shared folders, and more) awarded by this installation.
